*We initiated our project by installing OpenCV in our system.
*The image is read to the matrix with the help of OpenCV.
*We created a new directory and added our image file to it (sampleX.png).
*The command: g++ -fopenmp OpenMP_19EC10023.cpp -o output `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4 is used to run our program.
*The command: ./output is used to obtain our output.
*We will get the equalised image as well as the execution time
